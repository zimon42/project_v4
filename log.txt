Step : Create a React app that outputs Hello world
--------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
Start command prompt by clicking the manifying glass and typing cmd.
cd C:\wamp64\www\miedweb\
npx create-react-app project_v4 (npx is not a spelling error)
cd project_v4
npm start

localhost:3000 doesnt work
Now it suddenly works! I didn't do anything fix it. Maybe it needn't some time to start the server

Now lets edit to show "Hello world"

Open VS Code and click File->Open Folder from the File menu

Edited the App.js file. It now shows Hello world!

Next lets install git

First create a remote repository at github

There were problem creating the account
Password has been compromised in a third party data breach

Chose a harder password - works now. Here is the info:
Username: zimon42
Email: simon.wrang2@gmail.com
Password: ilv23456

Next start a repository on github:

Had to verify email

Now it works

Now lets install git on my machine

git.init
echo >>gittest.txt
git add gittest.txt
git commit -m "first commit"

Gives message: "Please tell me who you are"

Added email and name

Now it worked

Hm, I never had to input my password to my remote repository at github when installing git, or creating the local repository on my machine. 

Now when i pushed, I had to enter it

Stuck. Clicked Enter on the keyboard, then it continued

Still displays Hello World despite ive created a NumberScroller component that should display "NumberScroller".

Restared server - still doesnt work.

Fixed import NumberScroller in App.js. Now it works!!

Setting width for text field to 25 px, but still is long

Broke the import. Yielded a compile error. Then changed back, and now it works. This is the second time this happens. Next time, break the import and then fix it, to make it works. 

Fixed problem: I kept only get one text field when I had three number scroller components. In NumberScrollerPanel, had export default NumberScroller; when I should have had
export default NumberScrollerPanel;

TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of undefined. 
Solved: Changed from props.val to this.props.val. Removed props from render argument.

Next fix when click decrease button, decrease by one

Fixed so all buttons work!!

How do you comment several lines in React html ?
Use {/* */}

Number scroller list with array map works!!

Now I wanto save files (log.txt and src folder) to git

Did git add log.txt -- it worked

When doing commit, use -m flag, otherwise opens up some editor whish i don't know how to exit from.

How do you push to remote server?
git push origin master

Now that list works, what next?
Update the other vats

Updating other vats works!!

What to do next?
Add a lock button

Refactoring app with VatPanel etc
Stuck!

How do you indent a piece of selected code in vs code?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40492960/how-to-indent-format-a-selection-of-code-in-vscode-with-ctrlshiftf
Use Ctrl + ]? Its not working

Hello world not displaying when using three VatPanel where each VatPanel should output "Hello world"; Fixed: Forgot to add call to renderVatPanels method in render body

Cannot display image lock.png
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999367/how-do-i-reference-a-local-image-in-react
Solution:
import img from './lock.png';
<img src={img} />

NumberScrollerVatPanelTitle class is not having any effect.
Solution: Injected a syntax error and then corrected it

How do I pass state down from top component to a component much fruther down in the hierarchy?
Pass entire vat (not vats) object down to VatPanel component

Now incHandler and decHandler shows alert

inc and decHandler need the index of the changed vat
My solution: pass another attribute "index" down the hierarchy.

Pressing buttons works!! Updates the other vats correctly

Next fix LockSetter

LockHandler method in VotePanel file alerts correct index

Bug: Created a new LockHandler method without an alert, but it still alerted. Finally I figured out I had already made a LockHandler method further down in the code that was being used.

isLocked works!

HorizontalSlierVotePanel prints Hello world

Created state with 10 coca colas

How do I specify an image address without importing all of them?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42580130/display-images-in-react-using-jsx-without-import
Solution:
<img 
    src={ require("../images/"+this.props.vat.img)}
></img>

Shows soda images

Couldnt find module HorizontalSlider. Solved: forgot to add HorizontalSlider to path below
import HorizontalSlider from '../HorizontalSlider/HorizontalSlider

Don't forget to Save All!!!! That explains why I had to introduce a syntax error and then correct it to make the app work - files werent saved.

Problem: Slider bar anchored at bottom
Solution:
vertical-align: top

All 10 images displaying

Slider button graphics done!

Mouse down handler works!

I need to capture a mouse move event. But I wanto set it on the body element.

Solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32485520/how-can-i-add-a-click-handler-to-body-from-within-a-react-component 

Next. Set val in vote panel and should move the button accordingly
Must set style={style} in horizontalSliderButton

Working on calculating left
Working!

Used "static" keyword to define constants in config.js

can drag slider buttons!
Slow in Google Chrome
Bug1: when clicking the slider button again, jumps to beginning
Bug2: Error "nweVal" is read-only,
at if (newVal < 0) newVal = 0;

Solution to bug2: We have defined newVal as a const but when passing slide endpoints we altered the value and therefor must be "let".

Solution to bug1: Forgot to set oldVal in state in mouseDownHandler. The value being used was instead 0 which was the value the state was initialized to.

Next: Update other slider buttons

All of a sudden slider button is fast again in Chrome. Removed console.log in render method that was being repeated every time the mouse moved.

Working on toSpare. Not working. Solved: Calculated newVal too high up, before dVal was reduced. Solved by moving newVal calculation after reducing newVal

Sorts array of indices works!

Moves other sliders almost works. But when one slider button gets too close to the end, it starts shimmering.

Bug: Moves each other slider as much as the slider being dragged. Solved:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length-1);
Remove the -1:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length);

Oops should be:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length-i);

Still buggy. Flickering

index:1

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:138 distTo0:4.277777777777776
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:139 distAll:8.555555555555552
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:140 usedDVal:8.777777777777777
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:149 NOT distAll > usedDVal
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:137 index:2

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:138 distTo0:11.166666666666668

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:139 distAll:11.166666666666668
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:140 usedDVal:0.22222222222222499
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:145 distAll > usedDVal
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:189 mouseUpHandler

Seems to change mode when reached half way

Is oldVals not being updated?

Added this to mouseMoveHandler, but then speeds away
        // Set old vals
        let oldVals = new Array(this.state.vats.length);
        for (let i=0; i<oldVals.length; i++) {
          oldStateCopy.oldVals[i] = this.state.vats[i].val;
        }

Still working on this bug

Big improvement by using tempVals. 

Interesting: If sliders are oredered from top to bottom, no bug occurs.

Måste arrayen sorteras om?

Bug solved!!! Sorted on vat.vals when should have sorted on oldVats.

handleOthersSlider works in both directions!!

Next: Fix LockSetter

Toggles locksetter green and red borders

Next, if trying to drag slider with red lock: do not move. Done!

Next, do not move other sliders that are locked. Approach: in handleOtherSliders filter out arr with only unlocked indices. Works!

Next recalculate toSpare - works!

Next: Create router pages!

HomePage route displayes correctly, but cannot find modules AdminPage and VotePage.

New error: A <Router> may have only one child element"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42992911/react-router-only-one-child
Solution: You have to wrap routes in a div

Working! The other error of not being able to find modules are gone.

Working on HomePage component

Vote link works!

Removed comments to show all ten vats but still only shows the six vats. Solution: Restarted the server

How do you deploy a react application togheter with php?

Start by deploying a react app on the web hotel

$arr = array("name" => "simon", "age" => "42");
echo json_encode($arr);

Use Netlify

Next: Create a simple helloworld react app and try to deploy it (to githubpages?).

create-react-app helloworld

Created a remote repository "helloworld" on github. 

Deploy on gitpages:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yA7BGos2KQ&t=114s

Very good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y-PqBH-htk

1. In package.json add:
"homepage": "https://zimon42.github.io/helloworld",
at top level.

2. Add "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
under scripts

3. Install gh-pages:
npm install --save gh-pages

4. Run deploy:
npm run deploy

5. Look at homepage: https://zimon42.github.io/helloworld

Hello world worked!

Tried deploying project_v4. Displays nothing. No errors.

Is it because im not using Hastroute as desribed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yA7BGos2KQ&t=114s
?

Woo! Added, committed and pushed everything, and then deployed again and now the "Project v4" title shows. Try putting routes back. If it doesnt work, then use Hashrouter.
