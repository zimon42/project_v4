Step : Create a React app that outputs Hello world
--------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
Start command prompt by clicking the manifying glass and typing cmd.
cd C:\wamp64\www\miedweb\
npx create-react-app project_v4 (npx is not a spelling error)
cd project_v4
npm start

localhost:3000 doesnt work
Now it suddenly works! I didn't do anything fix it. Maybe it needn't some time to start the server

Now lets edit to show "Hello world"

Open VS Code and click File->Open Folder from the File menu

Edited the App.js file. It now shows Hello world!

Next lets install git

First create a remote repository at github

There were problem creating the account
Password has been compromised in a third party data breach

Chose a harder password - works now. Here is the info:
Username: zimon42
Email: simon.wrang2@gmail.com
Password: ilv23456

Next start a repository on github:

Had to verify email

Now it works

Now lets install git on my machine

git.init
echo >>gittest.txt
git add gittest.txt
git commit -m "first commit"

Gives message: "Please tell me who you are"

Added email and name

Now it worked

Hm, I never had to input my password to my remote repository at github when installing git, or creating the local repository on my machine. 

Now when i pushed, I had to enter it

Stuck. Clicked Enter on the keyboard, then it continued

Still displays Hello World despite ive created a NumberScroller component that should display "NumberScroller".

Restared server - still doesnt work.

Fixed import NumberScroller in App.js. Now it works!!

Setting width for text field to 25 px, but still is long

Broke the import. Yielded a compile error. Then changed back, and now it works. This is the second time this happens. Next time, break the import and then fix it, to make it works. 

Fixed problem: I kept only get one text field when I had three number scroller components. In NumberScrollerPanel, had export default NumberScroller; when I should have had
export default NumberScrollerPanel;

TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of undefined. 
Solved: Changed from props.val to this.props.val. Removed props from render argument.

Next fix when click decrease button, decrease by one

Fixed so all buttons work!!

How do you comment several lines in React html ?
Use {/* */}

Number scroller list with array map works!!

Now I wanto save files (log.txt and src folder) to git

Did git add log.txt -- it worked

When doing commit, use -m flag, otherwise opens up some editor whish i don't know how to exit from.

How do you push to remote server?
git push origin master

Now that list works, what next?
Update the other vats

Updating other vats works!!
